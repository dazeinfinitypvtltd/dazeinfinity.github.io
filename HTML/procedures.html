                  <p class="leading-relaxed"> 
                    At this point, the prime focus of the stakeholders and project managers is to note the exact things needed from any software under consideration.
                    A general outline is created for the software developers to focus on. This data is then analyzed to ensure its validity & any possibility for incorporation of the same. Lastly, 
                    a document for requirement specification is prepared which serves as a guideline for the next level of the software development process.
                <br>There are several questions to be asked at this stage, which include:<br>
                1. Who is supposed to use this software?<br>
                2. How will the software be used upon completion?<br>
                3. What type of data should be added to the software?<br>
                4. What should be the data output by this software?</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed">In this stage, the draft design is prepared for the software.
                    The system designs help in specifying the hardware as well as system requirements. 
                    It also helps with the definition of an overall system in software architecture.<br>
                    The design specifications for the system serve as the input for the following phase of the software development model. 
                    In this particular phase, test strategies are developed by the testers by mentioning things to test and the ways to check it.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed">This is the stage where actual coding begins. The main focus of the phase is the development of perfect codes by the developers. 
                    This particular phase is the longest in the entire protocol.<br>
                    This particular stage is very crucial for the developers. If anything goes wrong in the testing stage or any error is noted in the codes, 
                    it can lead to the repetition of the coding process, and the cycle goes on till the completion of the same. 
                    In this stage, all variants of the functional testing such as integration testing, unit testing, system testing, acceptance testing, 
                    and non-functional testing are done.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed">The finalized code is implemented into the software and then deployed or delivered to the customers to be used.<br>
                    As the product is being given to potential customers, the first thing done to ensure that it works fine on a large scale is to go with beta testing. 
                    If there is any possibility for changes or there are possible bugs caught during implementation, 
                    it is immediately reported to the team that engineers its errors to work fine in real-time. Once the changes are implemented with all the bugs fixed, 
                    the final dispersal or deployment is set in motion.</p>

                    This does not mean that the software will get corrupted. However, it might require occasional issues surfacing time and again. 
                    This particular process is termed as maintenance for the finalized product or software.</p>
